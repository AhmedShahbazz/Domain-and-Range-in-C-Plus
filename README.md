# Domain and Range in C++

## Project Overview

The "Domain and Range in C++" project implements a simple hash table for efficient data management and retrieval of domain names stored in a text file. This project utilizes a custom hash table structure to store strings and handle collisions using chaining (linked lists). It is designed to demonstrate hash table operations including insertion, searching, and collision resolution in C++.

## Features

Custom Hash Table: Implementation of a hash table using arrays and linked lists.
Collision Handling: Handles hash collisions using chaining (linked lists) with nodes storing strings and their occurrence counts.
Data Insertion: Ability to read domain names from a text file and insert them into the hash table.
Display Functionality: Display the contents of the hash table along with the linked list at each index if collisions occurred.
Collision Analysis: Reports the index with the most collisions and total number of nodes in the hash table.
Usage
Compilation
Compile the source code using a C++ compiler that supports C++11 or later. For example, using g++ you might compile like this:

bash
Copy code
g++ -o domain_and_range main.cpp
Running
Execute the program:

bash
Copy code
./domain_and_range
Ensure that there is a file named filename.txt in the same directory as the executable, containing the domain names to be processed. Each domain should be on a separate line.

Key Functions
void insert_data(string key): Inserts a domain name into the hash table.
void display(): Displays the contents of the hash table.
void read_data(): Reads domain names from a file and inserts them into the hash table.
void collision(): Prints detailed information about the index with the highest number of collisions and the total node count.
